## Overview

The `.devcontainer` directory provides a ready-to-use development environment using Docker Compose and VS Code Dev Containers. It includes all necessary tools and configuration to work with K0rdent in a reproducible, isolated container.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote - Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Open this repository in VS Code.
2. When prompted, reopen in the devcontainer, or use the command palette: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
3. Once inside the container, configure the environment:

   ```shell
   ssh devcontainer@127.0.0.1 -p 10022 /opt/mount.sh
   ```

4. You can now use the container for K0rdent development and testing.

    ```shell
    k0sctl apply --config ./hack/cluster.yaml
    k0sctl kubeconfig --config ./hack/cluster.yaml >./hack/kubeconfig.yaml
    ```

See [README](../README.md#6-deploy-management-workload) for to continue with deployment.

## Devcontainer Structure

- `Dockerfile`: Builds the devcontainer image with all required tools.
- `devcontainer.json`: Main configuration for the devcontainer, referencing `compose-dev.yaml`.
- `compose-dev.yaml`: Docker Compose file defining the `kcm` service, mounting the workspace, setting up volumes (including CRDs and SSH keys), and exposing ports (10022, 30443, 443, 6443, 80).
- `authorized_keys`: SSH public key for accessing the devcontainer.
- `crds/`: Contains Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) such as `es.yaml` and `gapi.yaml` for use within the devcontainer environment.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Devcontainer Fails to Start**: Ensure Docker is running and you have the VS Code Remote - Containers extension installed.
- **SSH Issues**: Make sure the `authorized_keys` file is present and correct.
- **Volume Mount Problems**: Check that the workspace and required files are accessible to Docker.
